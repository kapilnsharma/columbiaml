#From Columbia University ML Course with emeritus
### Build a KNN classifier using sklearn.
### ### specify n_neighbors as 10. Otherwise accept the `KNeighborsClassifier` defaults.

### Fit the model using the provided "X_train3" and "y_train3" variables, from above cell.
### assign the predictions from your model for the provided "X_test3" data to a variable called ans1.
### YOUR ANSWER BELOW
"""
Example:

# Code for Instantiating a KNN Model

# Fit KNN with X_train3 and y_train3

# Create Predictions on X_test3

ans1 = preds

print(ans1[:5])
#-->np.array([6 5 1 6 4])

### NOTE: Your predictions may look different due to how "random_state" depends on current time.
"""

clas = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=10)
clas.fit(X_train3, y_train3)
preds = clas.predict(X_test3)
ans1 = preds
